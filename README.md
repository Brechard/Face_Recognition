# Face recognition

Use the nearest neighbor recognition algorithm to perform face recognition on the given dataset. In particular, ORL_32x32.mat contains 
10 32x32 different images for 40 people. For some subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying the lighting, facial 
expressions (open / closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) and facial details (glasses / no glasses). Moreover, there is a train folder
which files account for the number of training images per person and are actually the corresponding indices for each one of the 400 images, 
classifying them as training or testing samples.
